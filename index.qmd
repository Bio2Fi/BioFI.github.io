# Overview
The focus of the lab is (primarily) on topics related to biodiversity, including quantifying and mapping biodiversity, understanding the drivers of biodiversity patterns and how biodiversity may be impacted by global changes, and working on making these findings relevant for decision makers. Work in the lab is open to any group of organisms, but tends to focus on plants (as they account for most of the biomass on Earth and their traits are primary drivers of terrestrial ecosystem functioning).  We practice Open Science and take a collaborative and cooperative approach to research.

# Research Projects
### Global Change and Conservation

### Macroecology

### Open Science
Open Science work in the lab includes both work focused on the development and dissemination of Open Science products and work focused on the impacts of Open Science. For example, we participate in the development and maintainance of multiple R packages, including [BIEN](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12861), [TNRS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TNRS), [GNRS](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268162), and [Wallace 2](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.06547). In terms of work focused on the impact of Open Science, we've published on the importance of [Open Science in trait-based ecology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1109-6), the need to [incentivize software developers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02008-w), and have shown how [Open Science can improve citation rates](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70030).


# Join the lab!
We're currently looking for Masters students to join the lab. Students should be strongly self-motivated and full of ideas they're interested in! In particular, we're looking for students that have an interest in either (or both) of the following approaches: 1) using data wrangling and coding to address large-scale questions, or 2) using field-based methods to address ecological or global-change questions. Email Brian if you're interested.
