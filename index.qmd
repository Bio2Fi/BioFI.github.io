# Join the lab!
I'm currently looking for Masters students to join the lab. Students should be strongly self-motivated and full of ideas they're interested in! I'm particularly interested in students that have an interest in either (or both) of the following approaches: 1) using data wrangling and coding to address large-scale questions, or 2) using field-based methods to address ecological or global-change questions.

Email me or something?
