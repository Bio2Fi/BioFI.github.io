# Lab Members

## Brian Maitner

*Academic stuff*

I'm an Assistant Professor of Global Change in the Integrative Biology Department at the University of South Florida - St. Petersburg. I'm a macroecologist and community ecologist who works across taxa (primarily focusing on plants and terrestrial vertebrates) using both ecological and evolutionary approaches with strong informatics and computational components. I'm a big believer in working collaboratively, which benefits from the integration of diverse perspectives and multiple skill sets.
