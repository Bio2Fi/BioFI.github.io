# Data

### Global 0.25-Degree Future Drought Layers
[Future Drought layers](https://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/globaldrought/) composed of SPI and SPEI indices for 23 GCMs of the NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 dataset, including historical (1980-2014) data and 4 future projections (2015-2100) under four climate scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. The drought indices were calculated for 3-, 6- and 12-month timescales. The data is gridded in a regular latitude-longitude format, with a spatial resolution of 0.25ยบ (~25 km) and monthly time resolution.
